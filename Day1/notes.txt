FTP Basics & Control Connection
Introduction to FTP Protocol (RFC 959)
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and server over a TCP/IP network.
Defined in RFC 959, it operates primarily on TCP port 21 for control commands.
FTP is connection-oriented and stateful, maintaining session information during transfers.
Control vs Data Connection
Control Connection:
Established when the client connects to the server on port 21.
Used to send commands (e.g., USER, PASS, LIST) and receive responses.
Remains open for the duration of the session.
Data Connection:
Used for transferring actual file data or directory listings.
Created separately, either actively (server connects back to client) or passively (client initiates data connection).
Closes after transfer completes.
Common FTP Commands
Command	Description
USER	Sends username for login.
PASS	Sends password for login.
LIST	Lists directory contents.
RETR filename	Retrieves (downloads) a file.
STOR filename	Stores (uploads) a file.
QUIT	Ends the session.
Differences Between HTTP and FTP
Aspect	HTTP	FTP
Connection Type	Stateless; each request is independent.	Stateful; maintains session with control connection.
Number of Connections	Single connection for requests/responses.	Two connections: control (commands) and data (transfers).
Data Transfer	Data sent over same connection as requests.	Data transfer occurs over a separate data connection.
Session Management	No persistent session; each request independent.	Maintains session state during connection.
Use Cases	Web pages, APIs, documents.	File transfers, directory listings.
This overview provides foundational knowledge of FTP protocol operations and how it differs from HTTP.
